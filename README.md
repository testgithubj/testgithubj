🚀 About Me

I am a Senior DevOps Engineer with extensive experience in automation, virtualization, cloud infrastructure, and software module development.
With a strong foundation in VMware virtualization and cloud-native services (AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Zabbix), I have led the design and deployment of scalable, secure, and cost-optimized systems for enterprises.

My career spans from software development (building enterprise applications) to DevOps leadership, giving me a unique edge in understanding both development and infrastructure lifecycles. I am passionate about automation, performance optimization, and mentoring DevOps teams to deliver high-quality, reliable systems that fuel business growth.
